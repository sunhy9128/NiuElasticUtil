# NiuElasticUtil
* Some elasticsearch interfaces for daily use for projects.
* Personally,the mysql-elasticsearch-jdbc have been installed and same to the logstash.
* For test, in the src,I set the cluster name the niu_cluster,which you may modify in the src code and the elasticsearch.yml to     your local cluster name.And the port is default 9300,which should change by your means.
* Of cours,in the first snapshot it is very simple even crude .I will enrich the features in the following months.
